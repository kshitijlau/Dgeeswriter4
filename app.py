    prompt_text = f"""
You are an elite talent management consultant from a top-tier firm. Your writing is strategic, cohesive, and you follow instructions with absolute precision and perfect grammar.

## NON-NEGOTIABLE CORE RULES
1.  **Language:** The entire summary MUST be written in **British English**.
2.  **Structure:** The entire summary MUST be a **single, unified paragraph**. There can be no deviation from this rule.
3.  **Competencies:** You MUST NOT use the exact name of a competency (e.g., "Results Driver") in the narrative. Instead, you MUST describe the behavior using a verb phrase (e.g., "...demonstrated an ability to drive results," or "...showcased strategic thinking.").

## Core Objective
Synthesize the provided competency data for {salutation_name} into a single, cohesive, and integrated narrative paragraph that adheres to all core rules.

## Input Data for {salutation_name}
<InputData>
{person_data}
</InputData>

## ---------------------------------------------
## CRITICAL DIRECTIVES FOR SUMMARY STRUCTURE & TONE
## ---------------------------------------------

1.  **CRITICAL OPENING SENTENCE PROTOCOL (AI-DRIVEN CONDITIONAL LOGIC):**
    * Your first task is to analyze the input data to find the single highest numerical score.
    * You will then construct the opening sentence based on the score's value and whether there is a tie, following these rules precisely.

    * **Rule A: If the highest score is 3.5 or greater (>= 3.5):**
        * The sentence must reflect a clear strength using the format: `[Name] [verb] a strong [capacity/ability] to [verb phrase(s)]`.
        * **For a single highest competency:** "Osman demonstrated a strong capacity to think strategically."
        * **For a 2-way tie:** "Osman evidenced a strong capacity to think strategically and make impactful decisions."
        * **For a 3-way tie:** "Khasiba demonstrated a strong ability to drive results, think strategically, and make impactful decisions."

    * **Rule B: If the highest score is between 2.5 and 3.49 (inclusive):**
        * The sentence must reflect competence.
        * **For a single highest competency:** "Pitiable demonstrated the competence to nurture talent." (Structure: `...the competence to [verb phrase]`)
        * **For a 2-way tie or more:** "Random evidenced competence in nurturing talent and thinking strategically." (Structure: `...competence in [noun phrase(s)]`)

    * **Rule C: If the highest score is less than 2.5 (< 2.5):**
        * The sentence must be a neutral observation of the highest-scoring behaviors.
        * **For a single highest competency:** "Fatema evidenced collaboration."
        * **For a 2-way tie or more:** "Wretched evidenced collaboration and customer advocacy." (Structure: `...[verb] [noun phrase(s)]`)

2.  **STRUCTURE AFTER OPENING: The Integrated Feedback Loop.**
    * Beginning from the **second sentence**, the rest of the paragraph **MUST** address each competency one by one in a logical flow.
    * For each competency, you will first describe the **observed positive behavior**.
    * Then, **IMMEDIATELY AFTER** describing the behavior, you will provide the **related development area** for that same competency, introduced with a phrase like "As a next step...", "To build on this...", or "He may benefit from...".

3.  **Name and Pronoun Usage:**
    * Use the candidate's name in the opening sentence. After that, use only the pronoun **{pronoun}**.

## ---------------------------------------------
## FINAL INSTRUCTIONS
## ---------------------------------------------

Now, process the data for {salutation_name}. First, analyze the scores to determine the correct opening sentence structure (A, B, or C) and ensure it is grammatically perfect. Then, create a **strict single-paragraph summary** that follows the **Integrated Feedback Loop** structure. The total word count should remain between 250-280 words.
